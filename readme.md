# About the Project 

This 0050yfinance project was compiled by Python 3.12.5. Based on the constituent stocks of Taiwan Top 50 ETF (0050), this project aims to select the potentially profitable stocks and draw their bollinger bands.

# Description

The file [plot_stock.py](https://github.com/yehhsinjung/Stock-0050-yfinance/blob/main/plot_stock.py) should be imported into the main file [0050yfinance.py](https://github.com/yehhsinjung/Stock-0050-yfinance/blob/main/0050yfinance.py), so that the stock_trend function can be called.
